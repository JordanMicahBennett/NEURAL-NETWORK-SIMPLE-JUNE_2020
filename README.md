Simple artificial neural network written from memory/scratch by Jordan in java

  Author: Jordan Micah Bennett
  
  Why?: This is practice writing of basic neural network from memory. ([I do this at the end of each year, or sometimes every 6 months](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE), for practice of fundamentals.)

  The problem space is [X-OR inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate). So the model does xor input prediction.
  
  Given two numbers in [X-OR space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate), the model will try to guess the output.
  
  For:
  
  a) Input=(0,0) output should be 0
  
  b) Input=(1,0) output should be 1
  
  c) Input=(0,1) output should be 1
  
  d) Input=(1,1) output should be 0
